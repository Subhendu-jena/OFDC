                The Odisha Film Development Corporation Ltd. (OFDC) has made significant strides over the years in promoting the Odia Film Industries. Established on 22nd April, 1976 following its incorporation as a public sector undertaking of the Government of Odisha, it has achieved milestones like setting up of Kalinga Studio which provided complete facilities for indoor and outdoor shooting, editing, dubbing, and music recordings. Such infrastructure building enhances cost-effectiveness and efficiency in Odia film production in comparison to other regional film industries such as those in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.
