                The Odisha Film Development Corporation Ltd. (OFDC) has made
                significant strides over the years in promoting the Odia Film
                Industries. Established on 22nd April, 1976 following its
                incorporation as a public sector undertaking of the Government
                of Odisha, it has achieved milestones like setting up of Kalinga
                Studio which provided complete facilities for indoor and outdoor
                shooting, editing, dubbing, and music recordings. Such
                infrastructure building enhances cost-effectiveness and
                efficiency in Odia film production in comparison to other
                regional film industries such as those in Tamil Nadu and West
                Bengal.
